       <p>Hi {receiver_name},</p>

        <p>I hope this message finds you well.</p>

        <p>My name is Shadi El-Fares, and I am reaching out to express my strong interest in opportunities within the Computing and Software Faculty at McMaster University, particularly in roles related to Data Science and Machine Learning. <br><br>
        
        While my formal education is in Software Engineering, I have a background in data analysis through hands-on projects utilizing Python, Pandas, and OpenPyXL. <br><br>
        
        Additionally, Iâ€™ve built and optimized data pipelines using tools like Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, and PyAutoGUI, which have proven invaluable in extracting and processing web data. <br><br>
        
        <em><b>This email</b> was sent through a Python email server (SMTP), part of the data pipeline I developed, allowing me to efficiently reach out to the entire Computing and Software Faculty at McMaster.</em></p>

        <p>I want to share that I am approved for the Work Study Program, and I am actively seeking a role for the upcoming academic year. While I have predominantly worked in Web Development and Design, I am eager to transition into roles that involve Data Science and Machine Learning, areas I am highly passionate about.</p>

        <p>I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my technical expertise can support your needs or to explore any referrals for positions where I can contribute effectively.</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and the broader academic community at McMaster University.</p>

        <p>Warm regards,</p>
